Teach myself backend

We wanna learn mongoose and mongodb using services and classes.

Resources : https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/mongoose/delete-by-id

Split these into different modules and learn independently
Integrate express, bodyparser, status codes, morgan, bcrypt, middleware, rate limiting, geolocation, salting and hash/tokenization (bcrypt), crud, sort and filter

i. Request and Response cycle

ii.CRUD:

i.https://attacomsian.com/blog/mongoose-delete-documents ✅
ii. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/routes ✅

iii. Understanding status codes in-depth (4xx-client, 2xx-ok, 5xx-server, 3xx-redirect) ✅  
Status Code 201 – This is the status code that confirms that the request was successful and, as a result, a new resource was created.
Typically, this is the status code that is sent after a POST/PUT request.

Export pattern in node js
a. module.exports = wiki
b. const wiki = require("./routes/wiki.js");

iv. morgan: HTTP request logger middleware for node.js ✅

v. Rate-limiting in node.js ✅

vi. salting and hash/tokenization (bcrypt) in node.js ✅

vii. Routing: https://vegibit.com/what-is-express-router-for/ ✅

viii. Swagger docs implementation ✅

ix. Socket.io implementation

x. Message queues ✅

xi. Mongoose queries: https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/mongoose/query ✅

xii. PATCH vs PUT: https://byjus.com/gate/difference-between-put-and-patch-request/#:~:text=PUT%20is%20a%20technique%20of%20altering%20resources%20when%20the%20client,without%20changing%20the%20whole%20data.
