Populate: sighs, i had a tough time understanding this concept. All you're populating is the property of the Model connected to another one.

Populate passes down the id to an internal function that simply filters document that match that criteria and returns the full object for you, that's all.

In MongoDB, Population is the process of replacing the specified path in the document of one collection with the actual document from the other collection.

Need for Population: Whenever in the schema of one collection we provide a reference (in any field) to a document from any other collection, we need a populate() method to fill the field with that document.

Hey, give me the full properties of this document in the collection stipulated in the Schema based on the id.
